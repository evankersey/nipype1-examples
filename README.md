# Nipype 1 example workflows

This package includes a set of example workflows contributed over a nearly a decade of development
of [Nipype](https://nipy.org/nipype).

These examples are [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
documents which solve specific problems using Nipype. In some cases, the same problem is solved
with multiple underlying tools.

The Nipype developers have decided to initiate the [niflows](https://github.com/niflows) project,
which will allow new workflows, or collections of workflows, to be separately packaged and made
available under a common interface and in a common namespace. This will permit each niflow
repository and associated package to describe its history in a natural way, and the level of
maintenance of a package will not be obscured by the development process of Nipype itself.

As these examples are didactic, improvements will be accepted. However, they will continue to use
the Nipype 1.x engine. When examples are written for the second generation of Nipype, they will be
packaged separately.

This package makes use of [Nipype 1 legacy
workflows](https://github.com/niflows/nipype1-workflows/).
